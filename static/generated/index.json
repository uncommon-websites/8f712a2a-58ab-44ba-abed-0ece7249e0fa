    "prompt": "A minimal interior scene with a soft gradient of teal tones from light at the top to deep at the bottom, created through the natural interplay of light and shadow on walls and furnishings, viewed straight-on. The room features subtle pixel-like textural details in the decor and surfaces, such as fabric or tiles, but no actual patterns or graphics. The space is uncluttered, inviting, and designed for versatility, with gentle transitions in color and a calm, serene atmosphere. No text, no posters, no screens, no abstract shapes.",
